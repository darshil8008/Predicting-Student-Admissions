# Predicting-Student-Admissions

Have used pandas, matplotlib and numpy libraries for data preprocessing and data visualization.  

Downloaded the student_data.csv dataset from kaggle.  

Used the get_dummies() function in pandas to one-hot encode the data.  

Have used keras sequential model for predicitons.  

The accuracy of model is ~70 %.
